# The-Crops-Guidebook
 Collaborative guidebook for the Crops bouldering area generated using the LocalBoulders framework

# Discussion
- How should the area be organized? The Book hierarchy goes book>area>sub area>formation>route>variation, for small areas you can bypass the sub area level (See pink tag in the Garden guidebook). I would recommend making the Crops one area, and maybe splitting it into logical sub areas as well (e.g. MILF Den/lower talus, Sarlac/upper talus).
- Color Scheme. Should this book use the same general color scheme as the Garden book (intro is blue, first area is red etc.)?
